# Mutual Fund Allocation Change Tracker

**Objective:**

Develop a framework to track changes in mutual fund allocations over time and provide insightful parameters for users.

**Description:**

Mutual fund holding data is available across various platforms (Zerodha, HDFC, Axis, etc.). Fund allocations change monthly based on the fund manager's decisions. This project aims to create a Python framework to manage this data and offer user-defined parameters for analyzing fund changes.

**Action Points:**

* **Data Handling:** Develop a Python framework to efficiently handle large volumes of mutual fund holding data.
* **User Input:** Implement options for users to:
    * Select the specific mutual fund.
    * Define a date range for analysis (e.g., last 5 months, specific start/end dates).
* **Change Analysis:** 
    * Analyze fund allocation changes within the specified date range.
    * Identify and display funds that underwent changes.
    * Provide detailed information on changes by fund and by month for multi-month ranges.
